# Instructions

## Starting server backend

The backend for all the exercises is located inside the directory `backend` at the root of the repository.

1. Setup/install backend

   - **this stage needs to be performed only once**
   - **you can skip this stage if the backend is already installed**
   - change working directory to `backend`
   - inside `backend` directory run `npm install`

2. Starting the backend server

   - change working directory to `backend`
   - inside `backend` directory run `npm run redux-thunk`
   - server listens on http://localhost:3001/

3. Stopping the backend server
   - press <`Ctrl-C`> while the server is running

### Resetting database back to its initial state

1. change working directory to `backend`
2. inside `backend` directory run `npm run reset-db`

## Setup the exercise

- change working directory to `redux/redux_thunk`
- run `npm install` to install all dependencies
- **Copy all components (`App`, `AddPlayer`, `PlayerInfo`, `PlayerLink`, `PlayersList`, and `RequestStatus`) from last weeks exercise `react/players_crud` as a starting point for this exercise.**
- API documentation can be viewed in [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Run the exercise

- In the backend directory start the server (`npm run redux-thunk`)
- In another terminal inside the exercise directory run `npm start` to run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
  to view it in your browser.

## Testing the exercise

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm test -- NameOfTheFile.test.js`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch modse on that particular file. Often useful when you want to explicitly work on a single file.

### `npm run html-test`

Creates a test-report.html file in the root directory that can be opened in the browser, perhaps a faster way to see which tests are passing/failing than going through tests in the terminal.
