## Advanced web front-ends course assignment

**NOTE**: The backend was done by the course staff at Tampere University.

The frontend folder contains the actual assignment implementation done by me (excluding the tests-folder). 
The main goal of the assignment was to create a frontend for a webstore using React and Redux for state management. 
I also used TailwindCSS for styling the components. Each file contains more in-depth explanations of each component in JSDoc.
