/**
 * Student instructions:
 *
 * Use the given props and react logic to create a ListPlayer component similar
 * to the ListPlayer component in the Vue exercise. Instead of using <template>,
 * use JSX to create the component. Use the given props to render the player's
 * name and id.
 *
 * The "onClick" prop should be a function which is called when the
 * player is clicked, and the id of the player should be passed as an argument
 * on its invocation.
 *
 * REMEMBER: use the same ids, classes and attributes as in the Vue exercise in
 * the same places to pass the tests.
