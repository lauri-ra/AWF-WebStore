/**
 * Student instructions:
 *
 * Use the given template with props to create a ListPlayers component similar
 * to the ListPlayers component in the Vue exercise. Instead of using <template>,
 * use JSX. Find a way to replace the v-for directive and v-on directive with
 * the appropriate React logic.
 *
 * The "selectPlayer" prop should be a function passed down to the ListPlayer
 * component as its onClick prop.
 *
 * REMEMBER: use the same ids, classes and attributes as in the Vue exercise in
 * the same places to pass the tests.
 *
 * BEWARE: some tests do not pass if you do not handle the case where the
 * players prop is an empty array, or null.
