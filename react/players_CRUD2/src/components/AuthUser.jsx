/**
 * Student instructions:
 *
 * Use the given template with props to create a AuthUser component similar to
 * the AuthUser component in the Vue exercise. Instead of using <template>,
 * use JSX.
 *
 * "handleSubmit" prop is a function that will be called when the form is
 * submitted. It is your responsibility to decide how the function knows
 * whether the user is registering or logging in.
 *
 * "handleLogout" prop is a function that will be called when the logout link
 * is clicked.
 *
 * REMEMBER: use the same ids, classes and attributes as in the Vue exercise in
 * the same places to pass the tests.
